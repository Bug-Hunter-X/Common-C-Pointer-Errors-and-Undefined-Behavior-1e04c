# Common C Pointer Errors

This repository demonstrates common errors related to pointers in C programming, including:

* **Dangling Pointers:** Pointers that point to memory that has been freed.
* **Memory Leaks:** Failure to free dynamically allocated memory.
* **Segmentation Faults:** Accessing invalid memory addresses.
* **NULL Pointer Dereference:** Dereferencing a pointer that has not been initialized or points to NULL.

The `bug.c` file shows examples of these errors.  `bugSolution.c` provides solutions and best practices for preventing such issues.  Understanding pointer manipulation is crucial for writing robust and secure C code.
